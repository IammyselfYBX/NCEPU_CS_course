    RISC - V is one of the most popular open source instruction set architecture in recent years, and is widely used in various application scenarios. 

This paper uses Virtualization Technology of QEMU to simulate RISC-V instruction environment, which is used to solve the problem of cross-platform model        deployment and operation.In addition, I transplanted Linux kernel, file system and network protocol stack on the simulated RISC-V processor, and finally tried to run RISC- V program on it. The main purpose was that there was not relative combination of theory and practice of the knowledge that I had learned in the undergraduate course. As the old saying goes "Paper will sleep shallow, never know the matter want to practice." On the one hand, can also rely on the memory of the book to say a few words, do a few questions, answer the teacher's several questions; On the other hand, I clearly realize that I have not learned well. If I study up on it a little more deeply, I will find that I can't explain a lot of concept clearly, let alone master it skillfully. Therefore, this paper will refer to the operating system, principle of computer organization, Computer architecture and computer networking that are the core   courses of computer science, incorporating RISC-V instruction set and Linux operating system, including step by step improvement of basic functions to achieve  a comprehensive understanding of the knowledge.
