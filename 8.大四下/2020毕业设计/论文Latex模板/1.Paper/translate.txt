RISC-V 是一款近年来最为流行的开源指令集架构，而且被广泛应用于各个场景。
RISC - V is one of the most popular open source instruction set architecture in recent years, and is widely used in various application scenarios.

本文是采用 Qemu 虚拟化模拟仿真出 RISC-V 指令环境，用于解决跨平台的模型部署和运行问题。
This paper uses Virtualization Technology of QEMU to simulate RISC-V instruction environment, which is used to solve the problem of cross-platform model deployment and operation.

并在模拟出来的 RISC-V 处理器上面进行移植 Linux 内核、文件系统以及网络协议栈，
In addition, I transplanted Linux kernel, file system and network protocol stack on the simulated RISC-V processor, 

最后尝试在上面运行RISC-V 程序，
and finally tried to run RISC- V program on it.

主要目的是因为本科所学知识理论与实践衔接并不紧密，感觉“纸上得来终觉浅, 绝知此事要躬行”，
The main purpose was that there was not relative combination of theory and practice of the knowledge that I had learned in the undergraduate course. As the old saying goes "Paper will sleep shallow, never know the matter want to practice."

很多内容似懂非懂，一方面还能凭借书本的记忆说上几句，做对几道题，回答上老师的几个问题；
On the one hand, can also rely on the memory of the book to say a few words, do a few questions, answer the teacher's several questions;

另一方面心里又十分清楚地认识到自己学得不是很到位，很多知识内容如果稍微较真一点深入地探讨一下，
On the other hand, I clearly realize that I have not learned well. If I study up on it a little more deeply, 

就会发现自己有很多内容解释不清楚，更谈不上熟练驾驭了，
I will find that I can't explain a lot of concept clearly, let alone master it skillfully.

所以本文将对本科所学有关操作系统，计算机组成原理，计算机体系结构还有计算机网络等计算机科学核心课程内容结合 RISC-V 指令集和 Linux 操作系统的移植包括一步步完善基本功能来达到对知识的综合理解
Therefore, this paper will refer to the operating system, principle of computer organization, Computer architecture and computer networking that are the core courses of computer science, incorporating RISC-V instruction set and Linux operating system, including step by step improvement of basic functions to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the knowledge.
